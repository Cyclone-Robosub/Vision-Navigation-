# Navigation Project

Navigation CrossPLA is a cross-platform navigation project written in C++ and configured with CMake. It leverages OpenCV for computer vision tasks and includes organized folders for source (src/), headers (include/), build scripts (scripts/), and platform-specific toolchains (toolchains/). The goal is to develop a robust, portable navigation solution that can be built and run on multiple platforms with minimal configuration.
