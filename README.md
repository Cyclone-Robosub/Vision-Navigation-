# Navigation Project

Navigation CrossPLA is a cross-platform navigation project written in C++ and configured with CMake. It leverages OpenCV for computer vision tasks and includes organized folders for source (src/), headers (include/), build scripts (scripts/), and platform-specific toolchains (toolchains/). The goal is to develop a robust, portable navigation solution that can be built and run on multiple platforms with minimal configuration.

## installation instructions
1. Depending on your OS (operating system) (eg: Windows, mac, and more) download that exact binary distribution.
        Cmake (3.31.4) = [text](https://cmake.org/download/)

2. Installing Opencv, Depending on your OS once again pick the correct download.
        Opencv (OpenCV â€“ 4.10.0) = [text](https://opencv.org/releases/)
            In my case it is windows. click on windows button then install to a path for me it is [text](C:\opencv)


# Setup Environment Variables

1. Create a new envionrment variable (Windows > Edit the system environment variables). Restart VS Code to take effect if already open.
   This step is required when we call find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED) in the CMakeList.txt file as we will see later.
   
   Under (User variables) click (new...) and add
   Variable name: 'OpenCV_DIR'
   Value value: 'C:\opencv\build'
   
   unless you installed the opencv somewhere else this should be right.

2. Add the following paths to your environment variables (Windows > Edit the system environment variables).
   This is to find the bin and lib folders.

   Under (User variables) click (path) and then click new and add these following 3 things (one by one)
   C:\Program Files\CMake\bin
   C:\opencv\build\x64\vc16\bin
   C:\opencv\build\x64\vc16\lib
